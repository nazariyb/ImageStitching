# SIFT for image stitching
My work is based on [Lowe, 2004](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/cs294/lowe-ijcv04.pdf) and [Lowe and Brown, 2007](http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf)
. In jupyter notebook file there is partly implementation of SIFT, and in 
stitcher.py there is assembling of OpenCV functions to provide basic image 
stitching
